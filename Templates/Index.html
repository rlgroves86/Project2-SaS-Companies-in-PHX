<div class="col-md-12"> <br> This chart represents the different industry types that are here in the Phoenix area. As you can see, Sales & Marketing seems to be the most prominent in the area, followed by Business Management & ERP. If any of these fields interest you, this is definitely the place to be!

  <div class="col-md-12"> <br> In this chart, we wanted to break down the areas these companies are located in. As you can see, Scottsdale and Phoenix alone make up for 70% of the companies in the area.

<div class="col-md-12"> <br> In this chart, we wanted to show the different types of funding that the software companies in the area have. While most of them are self-funded, there are quite a few that are VC-Funded. VC-Funded is when a firm has equity in the company since they have shown to have a good customer base along with a revenue strategy. There are also quite a few companies that are considered Angel of Seed Funding, which means investors are involved with a company that is in the very early stages of starting up and possibly no customer base.

<div class="col-md-12"> <br> In our final chart, we wanted to look at the different size companies that are here in the Phoenix area. As you can see, the majority of the software companies are on the smaller range. 69% of the companies have 50 employees or less.
